        We've been together for a while, so we thought we'd give you a snapshot of what we were doing each year around
        our wedding-day-to-be. All of these events happened within a few weeks of June 14th!

        We met the first week of college and were close friends for two years. In 2005 we went to Thailand with
        Stephanie's family (including sister/co-maid-of-honor Ashley), just as friends. Amazingly, the day
        Adam arrived was June 14th.

        <p>After we came back,
            Stephanie sent Adam an email professing her true feelings, then called him and told him to delete
            it before he opened it. He actually did! She knew she had found a true sucker, so she sent it again,
            let him read it, and thus began our journey together.</p>

        Adam's mom Sue was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer in 2009. Many years ago, we took
        trips to New Hampshire and Maine during the summers. Despite struggling with her cancer and
        chemotherapy, Sue wanted to take a big family trip, so we drove up to Maine and spent
        a week at the astonishingly beautiful Migis Lodge.

        Just before Sue's last weeks, she had a reprieve of relative healthfulness and energy after
        stopping chemotherapy. Incredibly, we were able to take one last family trip to some of our beloved
        New Hampshire destinations, including an obligatory dinner at the Common Man.
